# Badminton Shot Prediction
In this group project carried out with @Anapop7, the aim is to take a professional badminton match video as an input and predict the most probable space on the court where the shot will be hit by the player on the near side of the court. This is done by considering the positions of the players relative to each other and their body pose at the point-of-contact with the shuttle. Efficient use of Computer Vision ensures that this model is immune to subtle camera angle changes that are prominent across different tournaments with slight change of parameters in the setup stage. (More on this in the process explanation further!)

# Why this project? 
The inspiration for the project stems from my deep interest in badminton. Unfortunately, not a lot of technological support can be seen in badminton to the extent seen in sports like tennis and cricket. With this project, we have two major goals: 

  1. Helping aspiring badminton players to use the model as a guide for their own matches to get a most-likely shot placement that would have been done by a professional badminton player at the point-of-contact with the shuttle in a particular position on the court. 
  
  2. Enhancing user viewing experience. Greater inclusion of AI tools in sports makes it more appealing for the audience watching which subsequently helps the sport to grow.
